# Lab Report 1
1. No argument:

    ![cd](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1cd.png)

    > Without an argument, cd remains in the same directory since its not given a directory to change to.\
    > No error

    ![ls](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1ls.png)

    > Without an argument, ls prints the files/folders in the current directory.\
    > No error

    ![catmsg](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1cat.png)
    > Without an argument, cat prints nothing since it must be used with an argument.\
    > I wouldn't consider it an error since it prints what is expected of it when there is not an argument given.

3. Path directory as argument:

    ![cd](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1cdpath.png)

    > With a path directory as an argument, cd switches to the directory given. In this case, messages.\
    > No error
   
    ![cd](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1lspath.png)

    > With a path directory as an argument, ls prints the files/folders in the directory given, In this case, the files inside messages\
    > No error

    ![cd](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1catpath.png)

   > With a path directory as an argument, cat prints out that it is a directory.\
   > User error, since cat is meant for printing out the contents of a file but was given a path directory instead.
   
5. File as argument: 
    
    ![cd](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1cdfile.png)
    > cd command is used for changing directories, a file is not a directory.\
    > Prints out what is expected but could be considered a user error since cd is only meant for directories. 

    ![ls](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1lsfile.png)

    > With a file as an argument, ls prints out the path to the file since it isn't a directory it doesn't have any contents to list out.\
    > Wouldn't consider it an error, it prints out what is expected.
    
    ![catmsg](CSE15LA01-UD/lab1catfile.png)
    > With a file as an argument, cat prints out the contents of the file.\
    > No error.
