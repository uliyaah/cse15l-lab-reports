 **Which methods in your code are called?**
> The methods used are main method in StringServer and handleRequest() in Handler.

**What are the relevant arguments to those methods, and the values of any relevant fields of the class?**
> For main, the relevant argument is the port number given in the terminal, which I gave the value 4010. For handleRequest(), the relevant argument is the url, in this case http://localhost:4010/add-message?s=Hello.

**How do the values of any relevant fields of the class change from this specific request?**
> After the argument is passed, the string variable "mes" is given the value "1. Hello \n". Count is incremented by one to account for any future additions.

## Part 3:
During week 2 was the first time I used ssh to connect to a remote server which was entertaining. Week 3 I learned how to use scp and mkdir which will come handy for the future. The skill demo also cemented in my mind how to compile code.
